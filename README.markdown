Facebook Base Application for Rails 3.1
=======================================

*This was built using Ryan Bates' Railscast #241*

To build a new app using Facebook as the authentication, do the following:

1. Clone this app into your own project
2. Update the configuration in `config/initializers/facebook_config.rb`
3. Update the `.rvmrc` to use your own RVM (optional)

Enjoy!
